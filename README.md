# Vulkan-Robot
A Small interactive application of a robot in Vulkan

If you just wish to run the application, the .exe file is in Game folder. You may run it from there

Prerequisites for Code Compilation

Cmake
Vulkan validation layers / Vulakn SDK: https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home (Please download and install the sdk installer)
Windows: Although I am trying to make the code platform agnostic, right now the code runs on Windows alone

Download and extract all the files into a directory

Run Cmake from command line or use CLion (as I did)

Enjoy!
